    "Welcome! This tutorial explains math behind `PyDEns`, introducing the very details of equation solving. Our library is heavily inspired by the paper [DGM: A deep learning algorithm for solving partial differential equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07469), but is capable of doing way more: it is applicable to parametric equations, to equations with uncertainty, and can even be used to inforce prior information on solution via adjusting imperfect coefficients. This notebook introduces basic concepts, and is structed as follows:\n",

    "## Why do we use Neural Networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving deep into the realm of deep learning, we need to understand exactly the reasons, why we can't be satisfied with more traditional methods. After all, *finite element*, *finite differences*, and many others approaches are under active development for the last hundred of years, and should meet all the criteria of a good PDE solver, right? Not exactly. There are quite a few problems, related to both approaches itself and their software implementations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* most of popular numerical techniques operate on a fixed mesh. That greatly simplifies some of calculations and gives rigid structure, yet detrimental when solving problems that require very fine granularity: number of computations growth exponentially on cell size\n",
    "\n",
    "* working with uncertainty and parameters is both ineffective and ugly\n",
    "\n",
    "* in the recent years, accelerators like GPU and TPU have improved tremendously, yet most of PDE solving software does not utilize this potential to its full extent\n",
    "\n",
    "We can solve most of these problems by simply borrowing modern tensor-processing frameworks like `TensorFlow` or `PyTorch`: they allow us to seamlessly integrate most of GPUs/TPUs into our workflow, greatly increasing the speed of inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being mesh-free is useful not only with regards to finding solution on a fine grid: it allows us to incorporate prior information directly into the learning process. We can easily 'tell' algorithm on which areas it should perform best, and also point out places that we don't care too much about (again, saving precious computational resources).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the first glance it might seem that NN usage in such classical problem of mathematics goes against centuries of progress in that domain. We will shortly see that, in fact, neural network-based approximators fit very harmoniously into the ensemble of existing approaches, enjoying various tricks both from emerging field of machine learning and well-estabilished theory of differential equations."

    "Now we need to know some underlying theory behind the representational power of neural networks. A well-known [result](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem) states, that any real-valued continuos function can be approximated as closely as desired on a compact by a feed-forward neural network with a single hidden layer, finite number of neurons and nonconstant continuos bounded activation function. In other words, feed-forward neural networks are dense in the space of continuos functions (just like polynomials!).\n",

On the other hand, it [has been shown](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09375), that functions that can be represented as composition of functions with lesser dimensionality, can achieve desired tolerance with a much lower size.\n",

We are potentially talking about neural networks with hundreds of layers, so how do we do that?\n",

Usually they are used to compute gradients of the network output with respect to its weights in order to adjust them to the task; we use this capability both to make the approximation better, as well as calculate values of differential form.

On the other hand, shall we need it, we can simulate any fixed grid: for example, it seems reasonable to sample points near boundaries/zero-time at the very beginning of the learning process, so we can mimic some conventional numerical methods. Even during the actual inference we can *fine-tune* the network on the fly right before using it to obtain approximation of the solution.\n",

Unfortunately, backprop was not popular back then, so authors had to manually compute derivatives of network w.r.t. inputs. Due to complexities of the method and lack of evidence of practical benefits, this domain of research took a long pause.\n",
